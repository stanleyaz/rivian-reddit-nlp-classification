    "# **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "[`Rivian`](https://rivian.com/), a leading electric vehicle manufacturer in the United States, has hired me to perform a sentiment analysis of two `subreddits` - `r/cars` and `r/electricvehicles` - which it actively monitors on the popular Reddit platform. The problem is that the data previously collected before I was hired were not properly labelled, and so we do not know which of those unlabelled posts came from either subreddit. We do not wish to discard the unlabelled data because they are a substantial number, and due to some issues with [Pushshift's](https://github.com/pushshift/api) API, it was no longer possible to get data earlier than November. My boss has therefore asked me to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect more data from the two subreddits, using [Pushshift's](https://github.com/pushshift/api) API.\n",
    "2. Use Natural Language Processing to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem and I would attempt different models.\n",
    "3. In future, I can then use my best model to classify the unlabelled posts we have as belonging to either the `r/cars` or `r/electricvehicles` subreddits, and then carry out a sentiment analysis. (This third point is not covered in this project). \n",
    "4. Make a presentation to him and the rest of the team outlining my process and findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics for Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy of at least 0.90**. Accuracy is a key metric for this project. We ideally do not want the model to misclassify more than 1 in 10 posts otherwise we would not be confident of the model's usefulness.\n",
    "2. **F1 score of at least 0.90**. The F1 score is important for two reasons. First, we are as interested in correctly predicting posts from the `r/cars` subreddit as we are in correctly predicting posts from the `r/electricvehicles` subreddit. Neither is more important to us. Second, it turned out that our two classes were slightly unbalanced with the `r/cars` subreddit having the majority - 58% - of observations. As a result of this imbalance, accuracy is not a perfect metric. For these reasons, a strong F1 score is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data Collection**\n",
    "\n",
    "My target is to gather 5,000 posts from each of the subreddits, making a total of 10,000 posts. My thinking is that since my two selected subreddits are pretty similar in theory as they both deal with cars, my models would need substantial data in order to be able to differentiate between posts from either. \n",
    "\n",
    "The features to be collected are:\n",
    "1. `subreddit` - which would be one of either `cars` or `electricvehicles`; \n",
    "2. `title` of the post. \n",
    "3. `id`.\n",
    "4. `created_utc` column. This is useful in the data collection stage since there is a limit on the number of posts I can pull using the Pushshift API at any given time. I'll use the `created_utc` column to know the time of the last post pulled so that when I want to collect more data from a particular subreddit, i could use that time to specify. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any other column that would be used in this classification problem would be engineered from the columns above. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's begin with `r/cars`"

So it appears this is all the data we've got and we are stuck with an unbalanced dataset where the samples from the `cars` dataframe outnumber those from the `electricvehicles` dataframe. I could decide to remove some rows from the other dataframe to make it more even but I do not think that is ideal. So I am going to proceed with the unbalanced classes. However, I'll ensure to stratify when splitting into training and test sets, and i would also ensure to note the unbalanced nature of my classes when checking for the `accuracy` of my model.\n",
